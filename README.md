# pytorch_challenge

### [Pytorch Challenge](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/home) is an scholarship program created by udacity and facebook. 

On this repository, you will find all exercises related to the challenge which was based on taking the Course [Intro to Deep Learning with Pytorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188)

To be able to win the scholarship the student has to complete the course and final project which is to build an image Classifier that will identify different species of flowers

## Summary of Lessons 

### Lesson 1 - Welcome and Warmp Up 

On this lesson, I was able to familiarize myself with the program and now how 
it was structured so that I could approach it as it best. 

### [Lesson 2 - Intro to Neural Networks](./l2_intro_neural_networks)

This lesson was totally full of Maths, Linear Algebra concepts and Neural Networks Theory. 

It was really interesting and refreshing, maybe a bit hard for those concepts I have not touch in a while, but always worth it. 

Some of the main Concepts covered on this lesson: 

- Perceptrons 
- Perceptron Algorithm 
- Loss error function 
- One hot encoding 
- Cross Entropy 
- Gradient Descent 
- Neural Network Architectures 
- Feed Forward and Backpropagation 
- Overfitting and underfitting 
- Dropout
